# Check your Balance

1. Find out your principal id:

```
dfx identity get-principal
```

2. Save it somewhere.

e.g. My principal id is: b2ljk-ymc7j-dgo7o-igree-by37l-qefh3-v3coo-khkqh-imfsd-eajr6-tqe


3. Format and store it in a command line variable:
```
OWNER_PUBLIC_KEY="principal \"$( \dfx identity get-principal )\""
```

4. Check that step 3 worked by printing it out:
```
echo $OWNER_PUBLIC_KEY
```

5. Check the owner's balance:
```
dfx canister call token_backend balanceOf "( $OWNER_PUBLIC_KEY )"
```

# Charge the Canister


1. Check canister ID:
```
dfx canister id token
```

2. Save canister ID into a command line variable:
```
CANISTER_PUBLIC_KEY="principal \"$( \dfx canister id token )\""
```

3. Check canister ID has been successfully saved:
```
echo $CANISTER_PUBLIC_KEY
```

4. Transfer half a billion tokens to the canister Principal ID:
```
dfx canister call token_backend transfer "($CANISTER_PUBLIC_KEY, 500_000_000)"
```
