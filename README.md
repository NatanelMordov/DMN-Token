# DMN-Token App

## Overview

The Token App is a decentralized web application that enables users to manage and interact with DMN tokens. It combines the power of JavaScript for the frontend and Motoko for the backend, providing a secure and decentralized experience.

## Features

- **Token Management:** Users can create, view, update tokens on a decentralized platform.
- **Smart Contracts:** Leveraging Motoko for backend development, the app utilizes smart contracts for secure and trustless token transactions.
- **Decentralized Identity:** Integration of decentralized identity solutions for user authentication and privacy.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
  - [JavaScript (React)](https://reactjs.org/)
  - [Web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/) for interacting with decentralized networks
